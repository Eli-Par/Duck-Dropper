# Duck-Dropper
A relaxing game about filling a yard with thousands of rubber ducks.

Enjoy jazz music while covering the environment in rubber ducks. Watch as they cascade down piles of ducks and off of roofs in a satisfying and calming experience. The game has been optimized to allow many ducks on screen at once and various settings to allow you to get the best experience possible on your hardware.

## Controls
Click with the left mouse button to drop a single duck
Hold the left mouse button to continuously drop ducks
Move the mouse around to control where the ducks fall
Press escape (Esc) to pause
Press F2 to take a screenshot
Press F to toggle a framerate counter

## Settings Recommendations
Change the quality and anti-aliasing settings first to get better framerates. If this isn't enough or the only option lower in quality is Very Low, try reducing the duck quality setting.

Here is what the settings do:
The quality option changes how good the graphics look.
The anti-aliasing option has different settings that smooth jagged pixels.
The duck quality setting changes how good a large numbers of ducks look. This does not change the quality of any individual duck but rather changes how they are optimized with lower settings being faster but at the cost of visual fidelity.
